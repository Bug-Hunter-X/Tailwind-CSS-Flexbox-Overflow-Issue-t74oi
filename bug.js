```javascript
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a flexible layout with two divs side by side. However, if the content within either div exceeds the available space, it can cause unexpected layout issues.  The `w-1/2` class attempts to make each div occupy half the width, but if the content is too wide, it will overflow and disrupt the layout, potentially overlapping the other div.
